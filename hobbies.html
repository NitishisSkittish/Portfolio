              <td>Technology</td>
              <td>I meddle with technology all the time, trying to make it run better (for example my phone or computer) or just finding cool/useful hidden features to use. For example, I found a software that turns my chromebook into a second monitor for my main P.C. This way I can take my light chromebook to school, and use the power of my P.C and Windows 10 at home. I also have software that allows me to access my P.C remotely from any computer (for example my chromebook), I use this when I am at school and my chromebooks proccesing power is not enough for what I'm doing./</td>

              <td>Meddling (In General)</td>
              <td>I meddle with a lot of things in general, not just technology. For example, I fixed my bikes suspension, brakes, and handlebars (It was used and off facebook marketplace, $50 full suspension and pad brakes). We also bought another bike a few years back, for $20 I think, but no one ended up using it. So we salvaged the brakes for my little sisters bike brakes, and the seat for my bike. My dad and I also just mantain all the things in the house, Wi-Fi, Appliances, etc./td>
